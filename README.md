# My python utilities

This library bundles some Python code I frequently use. It used to be copy-pasted to different projects. Now I decided that maintaining it in a separate package is more sustainable.

## Installation

Use

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/f-dangel/python-utilities.git
```

then you can import the library as follows:

```python
import fdpyutils
```
